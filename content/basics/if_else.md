```python
a = 30
b = 20
if b > a:
    print("b is greater than a")
else:
    print("a is greater than b")
```

    a is greater than b
    


```python
a = 45
if a%15 == 0:
    print("a is divisible by 15")
```

    a is divisible by 15
    


```python
a = 7
if a%2 == 0:
    print("a is divisible by 2")
elif a%3 == 0:
    print("a is divisible by 3")
else:
    print("a is not divisible by 2 and 3")
```

    a is not divisible by 2 and 3
